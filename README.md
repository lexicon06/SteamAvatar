# SteamAvatar

The `SteamAvatar` class allows you to retrieve the avatar of a Steam user by using their Steam ID.

## Usage

To use the `SteamAvatar` class, simply create a new instance of the class and pass the Steam ID as a parameter to the constructor:

```php
$image_url = new SteamAvatar('STEAM_X:X:XXXXXXXXX');
```

## TODO

```markdown
- [ ] Add support for custom default avatar URL.
- [ ] Add support for self-usage to embed as an image.
- [ ] Add support for image size tweaking.
```
